### **GAMELEON**: Final model 
*  ``` GameleonCurfewBatch.gaml ``` Testing Curfew for West Humber-Clairville (Toronto Neighborhood of choice) in the realistic case (agents = 30030), both by imposing curfew_time = 6 p.m (or 7.p.m., or 8 p.m.), i.e. the daily time after which the curfew starts,  and curfew_delay = 5 (or 10): the curfew is effective 5 or 10  after the start of the simulation.
*  ``` GameleonCurfewBatch_1k.gaml ``` Testing Curfew for West Humber-Clairville (Toronto Neighborhood of choice) in the idealized case (agents = 1020), both by imposing Curfew_Time = 6 p.m (or 7.p.m., or 8 p.m.) , i.e. the daily time after which the curfew starts, and curfew_delay = 5 (or 10): the curfew is effective 5 or 10  after the start of the simulation.
*  ``` GameleonInvasionBatch.gaml ``` Testing the number of initial infected agents among 5, 10, 20, 30, 50
*  ``` GameleonTuningBatch.gaml ``` Testing different Betas, corresponding to the transmission rate of the epidemics for the realistic case (agents = 30030)
*  ``` GameleonTuningBatch_1k.gaml ``` Testing different Betas, corresponding to the transmission rate of the epidemics for the idealized case (agents = 1020)

### **MAC21** : Intermediate steps
*  ```MAC_19.gaml ```
*  ```MAC_20.gaml ```
*  ```MAC_20_Batch.gaml ```
*  ```MAC_20_Final.gaml ```
